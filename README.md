# Opencv
OpenCV (Open source computer vision) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision

-->Face & eye detection

# Edge Detection
Edge Detection is susceptible to noise in the image, first step is to remove the noise in the image with a 5x5 Gaussian filter.

# Color Filtering
you are probably going to convert your colors to HSV, which is "Hue Saturation Value." This can help you actually pinpoint a more specific color, based on hue and saturation ranges, with a variance of value

# Corner detection
Corner detection is an approach used within computer vision systems to extract certain kinds of features and infer the contents of an image

# Background reduction
Background subtraction is a major preprocessing steps in many vision based applications

# Face & eye detection
use of the haarcascade_frontalface_default file to detect face and haarcascade_eye file for eye
